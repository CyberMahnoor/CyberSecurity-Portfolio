Hi, Iam Mahnoor Fatima

Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC Enthusiast | Threat Hunter in Training

Iam an entry-level cybersecurity analyst with a passion for protecting systems, uncovering threats, and helping teams stay one step ahead of cyber attackers. I have been diving deep into SOC operations, threat intelligence, and incident response, and I enjoy turning complex security problems into clear, actionable solutions.

Skills & Tools

SOC & Monitoring: IBM QRadar, Wazuh, Splunk, Elastic Stack

Threat Intelligence: VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, RiskIQ, X-Force

Linux Security: Ubuntu CLI, permissions, iptables, auditd, bash scripting

Programming & Scripting: Python, SQL, Bash

Pen Testing & Recon: Nmap, Wireshark, Nslookup, OpenVAS, Google Dorking

Core Security Concepts: CIA Triad, NIST Framework, XDR, SIEM alerts, IOC management, encryption, phishing detection

I enjoy hands-on labs and simulations—they help me understand attacks from both defensive and offensive perspectives.

SOC Experience (Training at Trillium)

Monitored and analyzed logs using QRadar and Wazuh, triaging alerts and investigating suspicious activity

Investigated domains, IPs, and other indicators of compromise using VirusTotal, AlienVault, RiskIQ, and IPDP

Followed incident response playbooks, documented incidents, and escalated issues to senior analysts

Applied firewall rules and XDR policies to block malicious IPs and domains

Prepared daily, weekly, and monthly reports summarizing threat patterns and incidents

Labs & Projects

Incident Response Simulations: Responded to mock breaches and created structured response plans

SIEM & Log Analysis: Investigated anomalies in simulated logs to practice real-world detection

Python for Security: Wrote scripts to automate log parsing, alerting, and IP verification

Linux Security: Managed permissions, hardened systems, and monitored network activity

Pen Testing & Recon: Conducted scans using Nmap, Wireshark, OpenVAS, and simulated social engineering attacks

Cryptography Labs: Practiced hashing, encryption, encoding, and decryption

Hands-on labs and simulations have been essential in building my skills and confidence in cybersecurity.
