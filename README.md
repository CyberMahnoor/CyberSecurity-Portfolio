I am an entry-level Cybersecurity Analyst with hands-on training and practical experience in SOC-related tasks such as security monitoring, incident triage, and threat intelligence analysis. I have worked with SIEM tools, Linux systems, and basic scripting, and I am actively seeking an opportunity to contribute to a blue-team or security operations environment where I can continue learning and growing in real-world security work.

SOC Analyst Training Experience (Trillium)

Due to confidentiality agreements, internal systems and case data cannot be shared publicly. The points below describe the type of work and responsibilities I trained on.

Security Monitoring & Alert Triage

Monitored logs and alerts using IBM QRadar and Wazuh

Reviewed endpoint and network-related events to identify suspicious activity

Practiced distinguishing false positives from actionable alerts

Threat Intelligence & IOC Analysis

Investigated IPs, domains, and hashes using VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX, RiskIQ, and IPDP

Cross-checked multiple intelligence sources to validate indicators

Improved alert quality by reducing false positives during investigations

Incident Response & Escalation

Followed predefined incident response playbooks

Classified events by severity and impact

Escalated incidents to senior analysts with supporting evidence and summaries

Reporting & Documentation

Assisted in creating daily and weekly SOC reports

Documented investigation steps, findings, and response actions

Contributed to structured incident timelines and summaries

Access Control & Blocking Activities

Applied blacklist rules for malicious IPs and domains

Worked with XDR and monitoring interfaces to track asset behavior

Assisted with isolating potentially risky activity during investigations

Course-Based Labs & Practical Exercises
Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

The projects and labs below are based on structured, hands-on exercises from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and related training programs. They were completed to strengthen practical understanding of SOC workflows and security fundamentals.

Incident Response Simulations
Analyzed mock security incidents and drafted response actions

SIEM & Log Analysis
Investigated simulated log data to identify anomalies and suspicious behavior

Linux Security Labs
File system navigation, permissions, user roles, and basic system hardening
📁 Linux lab screenshots: ./LinuxLab/

Python for Security
Wrote small scripts to parse logs, validate IPs, and automate simple checks
📁 Python lab screenshots: ./img/PythonLab/

SQL for Cybersecurity
Queried sample datasets to identify suspicious login patterns

Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting & Cryptography (IBM)

These labs were completed as part of structured training to understand attacker techniques and defensive implications.

Reconnaissance & Traffic Analysis
Active and passive scanning using Nmap, Nslookup, Wireshark, and Google Dorking
📁 Recon labs: ./img/NmapLab/, ./img/WiresharkLab/

Vulnerability Discovery
Simulated vulnerability scanning using OpenVAS and CVE interpretation

Social Engineering Awareness
Mock phishing scenarios to understand tactics, payload structure, and pretexting

Cryptography Basics
Hands-on exercises with hashing, encryption, encoding, and decoding on Linux
📁 Crypto labs: ./img/CryptoLab/
