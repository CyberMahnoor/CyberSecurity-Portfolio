# Mahnoor Fatima | Cybersecurity Enthusiast 

Hello! I‚Äôm Mahnoor, an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** with a focus on defensive security, SOC operations, and threat detection. With hands-on training in **incident response**, **SIEM tools**, and **threat intelligence**, I‚Äôm building a solid foundation to contribute to real-world security teams.

## üìÇ Projects & Tasks (SOC Analyst Training ‚Äì Trillium)
While I cannot share internal or confidential project details, here are some key cybersecurity tasks and simulations I completed during my SOC analyst training program:

### üîç  Security Event Monitoring
- Monitored and analyzed logs using **IBM QRadar** and **Wazuh**.
- Conducted alert triage and reviewed suspicious activities across systems and endpoints.
- Worked with **Elastic Stack (ELK)** for log searching and visualization.

### üõ°Ô∏è Threat Intelligence & IOC Verification
- Investigated IPs and domains using **VirusTotal**, **IPDP**, **AlienVault OTX**, and **RiskIQ**.
- Assessed threat indicators and reduced false positives during event analysis.

### üö® Incident Response & Escalation
- Followed incident response procedures to classify and escalate events.
- Managed and documented incidents through a structured workflow in coordination with the SOC team.

### üìä Reporting & Documentation
- Generated daily, weekly, and monthly security summaries.
- Reported findings, incident patterns, and remediation suggestions to improve threat visibility.

### üîê Access Control & Blacklist Filtering
- Identified and blocked malicious IPs/domains based on threat intelligence feeds.
- Practiced use of **XDR frameworks** for endpoint detection and response.

### üí° Tools & Skills Applied
-  **SIEM Tools**: IBM QRadar, Wazuh
-  **Threat Intelligence**: VirusTotal, RiskIQ, AlienVault, IPDP
- **Incident Handling**: Detection, triage, documentation

## üéì Course-Based Projects & Labs

Below are key tasks, labs, and simulations completed through my certification coursework and self-study programs:

###  Google Cybersecurity Certificate (Coursera)

- **Incident Response Simulation**
  - Practiced detection, escalation, and containment based on mock breaches.
  - Drafted response plans and stakeholder communication outlines.

- **SIEM & Log Analysis**
  - Used mock log files to detect anomalies and investigate events.
  - Simulated alert analysis using SIEM concepts and tools like Splunk/Wazuh (externally).

- **Linux Security & CLI**
  - Navigated Ubuntu CLI: users, permissions, file systems, process monitoring.
  - Simulated secure configuration and system hardening using CLI tools.

- **SQL & Data Investigation**
  - Queried structured security logs to extract relevant indicators.
  - Wrote conditional and multi-table queries to support threat investigations.

- **Python Automation for Security**
  - Built basic Python scripts for:
    - Parsing logs and extracting indicators
    - IP reputation checks using APIs
    - Automating alert correlation logic

###  Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting & Cryptography

- **Reconnaissance Labs**
  - Performed passive and active scanning using tools like `Nmap`, `Nslookup`, and Google Dorking.
  - Used banner grabbing, packet sniffing (Wireshark), and DNS enumeration.

- **Vulnerability Discovery**
  - Conducted mock vulnerability scans with tools like `OpenVAS` and `Nessus`.
  - Interpreted CVEs and tested exploits in lab environments.

- **Social Engineering Awareness**
  - Simulated phishing and spear-phishing scenarios.
  - Studied real-world attack vectors and email payload examples.

- **Cryptography Fundamentals**
  - Studied symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
  - Applied basic encoding and decryption tasks using Python.

### Linux & CLI Projects

- User and group permission control (chmod, chown)
- Monitoring tools: `top`, `htop`, `netstat`, `iptables`
- Basic firewall rules and service hardening
- Bash scripting for log filtering and file manipulation

---

###  Python for Cybersecurity (Coursera)

- Created scripts to:
  - Scan log files and extract suspicious activity
  - Check hash values against known malware databases
  - Generate alerts for unusual port usage or login attempts
